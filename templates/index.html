        <h6>Armenian Cuisine</h6>
        <p class="cuisine-p">
          National cuisine is an element of the national culture, which holds
          not only the history of the people, but his mentality, spirit and
          character. Culinary traditions of Armenia originate from ancient
          times. It is known that the Armenians were aware of the processes of
          fermentation and baking even 2500 years ago. Armenian bread - lavash,
          has been included in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage by
          UNESCO 2014. Armenian cuisine is as diverse as Armenia itself.
          Armenian dishes remain unchanged. Tradition is manifested in the
          cooking technologies, in the use of old kitchen utensils, as well as
          in an assortment of food. When cooking dishes the pottery is used, as
          well as a special kind of fireplace known as tonir. Tonir is a tapered
          cylinder, made of refractory clay and dug in the ground. Tonir is used
          not only for baking lavash, but also for cooking soups and vegetables
          as well as smoked fish and poultry.Armenian cuisine has a variety of
          dishes on the composition, as well as a complex flavor and aroma
          range. This is due to the fact that the products used in Armenian
          cuisine, grow steadily in the territory of the Armenian plateau and
          the Ararat Valley. Main dishes of Armenian cuisine are dishes of meat,
          in various ways of preparation. abundance of meat on the Armenian
          table is the result of ancient cattle breeding on the territory of
          modern Armenia. Lamb, beef, veal, pork, and poultry are used in the
          diet of the Armenians.

            <h2>Basturma</h2>
            <p class="description-p">
              Making Basturma is an ancient Armenian practice, which was once
              viewed as something of pure significance. Basturma is a special,
              processed dried raw meat made from beef tenderloin. The meat is
              then cut and salted and put aside for a few days so it can absorb
              the salt. Then, the cured meat is dipped into a special mixture of
              fenugreek, salt, ground red pepper, and garlic and hung to air
              dry. It needs to be kept in a cool corner, allowing you to enjoy
              it for up to 3 months. The process of making basturma dates back
              to medieval Armenia, and it was so common among Armenians at the
              time that Basturmajian became a surname that is still used
              nowadays. It is served in paper-thin slices as an appetizer or can
              be added in omelets and salads to give them a unique taste.

            <h2>Tolma</h2>
            <p class="description-p">
              One of the easiest dishes in Armenia cuisine (if cooked correctly)
              is definitely Tolma or Dolma (Տոլմա). It is a dish made with meat
              and spices and other ingredients rolled into grape leaves (most
              popular) or cabbage. Alternatively, it can be stuffed in
              vegetables like eggplant, tomato, pepper, or even stuffed in
              apples. Tolma is an old dish popular in the Caucasus, Central
              Asia, the Middle East, and even in many Mediterranean countries.
              In Armenia, tolma has been around for centuries and is a very
              important part of the cuisine. There is even a Tolma festival that
              takes place in the country where you can try over 50 different
              types of the Armenian food! The typical ingredients for tolma are
              beef mince, rice, chopped onion, coriander and parsley, chopped
              garlic, tomato sauce, black pepper, salt, and grape leaves. After
              mixing all the ingredients together with the minced meat, the
              tolma is assembled layer by layer in a pot and prepared on a 150C
              fire for 50-60 minutes without mixing because you cant mix tolma
              (it’s an unwritten rule in Armenia)!

            <p class="description-p">
              Kufta (or qyufta in Armenian) is an interesting Armenian dish that
              is savory and absolutely delicious. The dish is reminiscent to
              meatballs and it is a part of every wedding or large gathering in
              Armenia and the kufta is served in different manners depending on
              where in Armenia you are. One of the most popular types is
              Echmiadzin kufta. But, there is a different type called Ishli
              Kufta. The main ingredients in kufta are beef, onion, butter, egg,
              black pepper, and salt. It’s boiled in water and then served with
              butter, or it is boiled and then fried, depending on how you like
              it.

            <h2>Zhingyalov hats</h2>
            <p class="description-p">
              Ask any Armenian about the dish that symbolizes Artsakh, and the
              answer will undoubtedly be Jingyalov Hats. For decades, the
              preparation of this dish signaled the arrival of spring in
              Artsakh, with the entire family participating in the process. It
              is a complete vegan and Lent-friendly dish full of chopped greens,
              where the balance of sour, herb, and bitter notes should always be
              achieved. Greens are mixed and matched, then stuffed into a
              paper-thin flatbread, which then cooks on the stovetop. Don’t be
              confused in case you can’t identify a single herb in jingyalov
              hats, because it might include more than 40 herbs in different
              recipes! Nine of the herbs are considered essentials (coriander,
              green garlic, nettle, capsella, chickweed, kdzmdzuk, spring onion,
              mint, sorrel). Take a trip to Artsakh and try one made by locals –
              you certainly won’t regret it!

            <h2>Pakhlava</h2>
            <p class="description-p">
              The list of Armenian sweet dishes wouldn’t be complete without
              this little gem, Pakhlava, which originated from the eastern
              cuisine. In Western Armenia, it was called Baklava, while in the
              Eastern part, they call it Pakhlava. This mouthwatering pastry
              with multi-layered paper-thin dough, chopped walnuts, and honey
              will certainly not leave you disappointed. The mixture of sugar
              and walnuts is added to each dough layer, put in a large pan to
              bake, and when ready, the final dessert is topped with honey or
              syrup. It is a popular dish in not only Armenia but also in Iran,
              Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Greece, albeit with some variations.
              Nowadays, Gavar is a renowned place where you can try the best
              Paklava with its traditional unique flavors. Traditionally it was
              a must serve dessert during weddings, baptisms, and birthdays.
              Pakhlava has now become a common dessert found in almost every
              restaurant and cafe in Yerevan.

            <h2>Sujukh</h2>
            <p class="description-p">
              In case you have a sweet tooth and are really keen to discover the
              full range of Armenian sweet assortment, you certainly should not
              miss trying Armenian sweet sujukh. Since ancient times, its
              preparation process was like a ritual and a reason for family
              gatherings. It is a tasty sausage-shaped threaded sweet made from
              walnuts and fruit juice of your choice. It is a nutritious snack
              that can be eaten for breakfast or as an after-meal dessert. At
              first, the walnuts are threaded on a durable string and put aside.
              Next comes making the syrup on the gas stove from fruit juice
              (grape juice is mainly used), sugar, and flour. Stir it until it
              becomes thick and brown and dip the thread in it and hang to dry.
              Sujukh season starts in mid-fall when the walnuts are fresh and
              soft, and sujukh is primarily made in the town of Ashtarak,
              Aragatsotn region (known as the land of walnuts).
